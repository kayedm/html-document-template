        <p>On a sunny Sunday morning, a very hungry caterpillar hatched out of a tiny egg. He was very hungry. On Monday, he ate through one apple. But he was still hungry. On Tuesday, he ate through two pears. On Wednesday, he ate through three plums. On Thursday, he ate through four strawberries. On Friday, he ate through five oranges. But he was still hungry. On Saturday, he ate through a piece of chocolate cake, an ice cream cone, a pickle, a slice of Swiss cheese, a slice of salami, a lollipop, a piece of cherry pie, a sausage, a cupcake, and a slice of watermelon. That night, he had a stomach ache. On Sunday, he ate a green leaf and felt better. He was now a big, fat caterpillar. He spun a cocoon around himself and went to sleep. When he woke up, he was a beautiful butterfly</p>

            <p>The Very Hungry Caterpillar is the third book Carle illustrated and only the second he wrote himself.

                The plot originated as a story called A Week with Willi the Worm, which featured a bookworm named Willi. Carle was inspired to write the story after using a hole punch that reminded him of a worm. Ann Beneduce, Carle's editor, advised him that a worm would not make a likable protagonist, instead recommending a caterpillar.
